# cryptosum
I really love puzzles, and cryptosums are the best. They can be found in The Weekend Australian - but once a week wasn't enough, so I figured I'd make something so I could generate them myself.
Keen to make something that can solve them quicker than me too!

```
ruby cryptosum_generator.rb
```
